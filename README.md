# SimpleStocks
Stock trading application

Simple Stocks is a simpe stock trading mobile application in the works.  
For our Software Engineering course at Purdue Fort Wayne, we 
were given the task of creating a project using the SDLC.

1. To run SimplStocks please install Android Studio.

2. Once installed please import the github repository "checkout through github"

3. In order to view the application through an emulator you must download an AVD (Android Virtual Device)

4. To do this click Tools -> Create Virtual Device -> 
            Pick a device (Pixel 3 works) -> Select System Image -> Next->Finish
            
5. Once the emulator has been installed run it.

6. In order to run the application on the emulator you must first install it on the device.  To do this just click the run
    symbol.
    
That's it!
